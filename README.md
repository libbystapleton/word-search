# word-search
WordSearch is a standard word search game in which the player is presented with a list of words as well as a grid of randomized letters. The objective of the game is to locate and highlight each of the given words that are hidden within the grid. The creation of this project was done as part of the first module in the Get Coding program.

FEATURES

Three levels (easy, medium, hard) for the player to select from. Each level increases in difficulty as the dimensions of the grid become larger and more words are to be found.

MOTIVATION

For my very first project I wanted to create something that was relatively simple but would also challenge me in learning the logic behind HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My love for mobile word games such as Wordscapes is ultimately what inspired me to create a word search game.
